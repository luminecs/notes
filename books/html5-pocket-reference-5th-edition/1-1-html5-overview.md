# HTML5 Overview

HTML5 offers new features (elements, attributes, event handlers, and APIs) for easier web application development and more sophisticated(复杂的) form handling.

The HTML5 specification is based on HTML 4.01 Strict, but unlike previous HTML Recommendations, **HTML5 does not use a Document Type Definition.** **Instead, it uses the Document Object Model (DOM, the "tree" formed by a document's structure) as its basis rather than a particular set of syntax rules.** It also differs from previous recommendations in that **it includes detailed instructions for how browsers should handle malformed(异常、格式错误) and legacy(遗留、遗产) markup.**

## W3C and WHATWG

There are two organizations maintaining slightly different HTML specifications as of this writing.

HTML5 was originally written by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). In 2003, members of Apple, Mozilla, and Opera formed the WHATWG to further(促进) the development of HTML in a way that was consistent(一致的、持续的、连贯的) with real-world authoring(创作) practices and browser behavior. Their initial documents, Web Applications 1.0 and Web Forms 1.0, were rolled together into(一起卷入) HTML5,

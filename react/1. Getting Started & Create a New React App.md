React is a JavaScript library to building user interfaces.

## Create React App
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is the best way to start building a new **single-page** application in React.

You'll need to have **Node >= 14.0 and npm >= 5.6** on your machine. To create a project, run:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Under the hood,  `create-react-app` uses `Babel` and `webpack`.

A JavaScript build toolchain typically consists of:
- package manager, such as yarn or npm. It lets you take advantage of a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, and easily install or update them.
- bundler, such as webpack or Parcel. It lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time.
- compiler, such as Babel. It lets you write modern JavaScript code that still works in olders browsers.

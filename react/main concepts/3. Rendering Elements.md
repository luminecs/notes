# Rendering Elements

Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create.
React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

> **Note:**
> One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of "components". Elements are what components are "made of".

## Rendering an Element into the DOM
```html
<div id="root"></div>
```
We call this a **"root" DOM node** because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

To render a React element, first pass the DOM element to `ReactDOM.createRoot()`, then pass the React element to `root.render()`:
```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root')
);
root.render(element);
```
## Updating the Rendered Element
React elements are **immutable**. Once you create an element, you can't change its children or attributes. 

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to `root.render()`.

```js
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root')
);

function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  root.render(element);}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```
It calls `root.render()` every second from a `setInterval()` callback.

> **Note:**
> In practice, most React apps only call `root.render()` once.

## React Only Updates What's Necessary
React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by React DOM.

# State and Lifecycle

In Rendering Elements, we call `root.render()` to change the rendered output.

```js
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

function Clock(props) {
  return (
    <div>      
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>      
      <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>    
    </div>  
  );
}

function tick() {
  root.render(<Clock date={new Date()} />);
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```
Ideally we want to write this once and have the `Clock` update itself:
```js
root.render(<Clock />);
```
To implement this, we need to add "state" to the `Clock` component.
State is similar to props, but it it private and fully controlled by the component.

## Converting a Function to a Class
You can convert a function component like `Clock` to a class in five steps:
- 1. Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends `React.Component`.
- 2. Add a single empty method to it called `render()`.
- 3. Move the body of the function into the `render()` method.
- 4. Replace `props` with `this.props` in the `render()` body.
- 5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.
```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
The `render` method will be called each time an update happens.

## Adding Local State to a Class
We will move the `date` from props to state in these steps:

- 1. Replace `this.props.date` with `this.state.date` in the `render()` method:
```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>      
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
- 2. Add a **class constructor** that assigns the initial `this.state`.
```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  // Class components should always call the base constructor with `props`
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};  
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
- 3. Remove the `date` prop from the `<Clock />` element.

The result looks like this:
```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {    
    super(props);    
    this.state = {date: new Date()};  
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>      
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clock />);
```
Next, we'll make the `Clock` set up its own timer and update itself every second.

## Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class
In applications with many components, it's very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.

We want to set up a timer whenever the `Clock` is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called "**mounting**" in React.

We also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the `Clock` is removed. This is called "**unmounting**" in React.

We can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts.

```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {  }
  componentWillUnmount() {  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
These methods are called "**lifecycle methods**".

The `componentDidMount()` method runs after the component output has been rendered to DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:

```js
  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
  }
```

While `this.props` is set up by React itself and `this.state` has a special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesn't participate in the data flow (like a timer ID).

```js
  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);  
  }
```

Finally, we will implement a method called `tick()` that the `Clock` component will run every second. **It will use `this.setState()` to schedule updates to the component local state:**
```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {    
    this.setState({date: new Date()});  
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clock />);
```

## Using State Correctly
There are three things you should know about `setState()`.

### 1. Do Not Modify State Directly
For example, this will not re-render a component:
```js
// Wrong
this.state.comment = 'Hello';
```
Instead, use `setState()`:
```js
// Correct
this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});
```
**The only place where you can assign `this.state` is the constructor**.

### 2. State Updates May Be Asynchronous
React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance.
**Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asychronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state**.
For example, this code may fail to update the counter:
```js
// Wrong
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
});
```
To fix it, use a second form of `setState()` that accepts a function rather than an object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument:
```js
// Correct
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
```
We used an arrow function above, but it also works with regular functions:
```js
// Correct
this.setState(function(state, props) {
  return {
    counter: state.counter + props.increment
  };
});
```

### 3. State Updates are Merged
When you call `setState()`, React merges the object you provide into the current state.
For example, your state may contain several independent variables:
```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
    posts: [],
    comments: []    
  };
}
```
Then you can update them independently with separate `setState()` calls:
```js
componentDidMount() {
  fetchPosts().then(response => {
    this.setState({posts: response.posts});
  });

  fetchComments().then(response => {
    this.setState({comments: response.comments});
  });
}
```

## The Data Flows Down

Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they shouldn't care whether it is defined as a function or a class.

This is why state is often called **local** or **encapsulated**. It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it.

A component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components:

```js
<FormattedDate date={this.state.date} />
```

The `FormattedDate` component would receive the `date` in its props and wouldn't know whether it came from the `Clock`'s state, from the `Clock`'s props, or was typed by hand:

```js
function FormattedDate(props) {
  return <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>;
}
```

The result:

```js
function FormattedDate(props) {
  return <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>;
}

class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({
      date: new Date()
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <FormattedDate date={this.state.date} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

This is commonly called a "**top-down**" or "**unidirectional**" data flow. Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components "below" them in the tree.

To show that all components are truly isolated, we can create an `App` component that renders three `Clock`s:

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Clock />
      <Clock />
      <Clock />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Each `Clock` sets up its own timer and updates independently.

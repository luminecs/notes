### Handing Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:
- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

For example, the HTML:

```js
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

is slightly different in React:

```js
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

**Another difference is that you cannot return `false` to prevent default behavior in React. You must call `preventDefault` explicitly.** For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of submitting, you can write:

```js
<form onsubmit="console.log('You clicked submit.'); return false">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In React, this could instead be:

```js
function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('You clicked submit.');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Here, `e` is a synthetic(合成的) event. React defines these synthetic events according to the W3C spec, so you don't need to worry about cross-browser compatibility. React events do not work exactly the same as native events.
